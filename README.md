# tic-tac-toe-node
TicTacToe NodeJS application

API requirements:
• create a new game (it can either be single player or multiplayer)
• join an existing game (with id provided when new game was created)
• make a new move
• get live results via subscription
• get history for a game by id

Technical requirements:
• TypeScript must be used
• GraphQL must be used
• some sort of DI must be used

Remarks:
• for single player, AI moves can be random (better implementation is a plus)
• usage of database is not needed (but make a system where it can be easily added in the future)
• try to create a meaningful logging system
• extend game if needed to cover any potential game related problems
• README.md file should be present in the root of the project, explaining:
    ◦ how to run the project
    ◦ architecture considerations
    ◦ whatever relevant for others to know or pay attention to
• solution should be provided as a git repository (github, bitbucket)
• for debugging purposes Altair GraphQL client can be used (subscriptions especially)

TODO:
1. startup application
2. study how to manage state of the application with stateless implementation without a database
